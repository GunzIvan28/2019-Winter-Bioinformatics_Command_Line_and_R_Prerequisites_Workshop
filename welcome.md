## Workshop Goals

To cover the **"prerequisites for doing bioinformatics"**

* Access to a multi-core (24 cpu or greater), ‘high’ memory 64Gb or greater Linux server.
* Familiarity with the ’command line’ and constructing scripts/pipelines.
* Basic knowledge of how to install software
* Basic knowledge of R (or equivalent) and statistical programming
* Basic knowledge of Statistics and model building

* Goal is 30-40% lecture/discussion 60-70% hands-on

## Internet

You will need to access the UCD wireless via your laptop to participate in the hands-on exercises.

### Eduroam

Many academic institutions are part of Eduroam. (See "List of Institutions" under
"Members" at https://www.eduroam.us/ to find out if your institution is a member.) Please make sure you
can log into Eduroam with your device at your home institution, which will make things easier once you come to UCD.

### UCD Guest wireless
